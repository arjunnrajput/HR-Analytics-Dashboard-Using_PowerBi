# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-for-Employee-Retention

I played the role of an HR Analyst to build a visually immersive and interactive dashboard using Power BI. The goal was to understand why employees are leaving the organization, enabling the identification of key factors related to attrition. This insight facilitated data-driven decisions to reduce the attrition rate by improving the hiring process and enhancing the employee experience, ultimately making the workforce more productive and gaining employee trust.
